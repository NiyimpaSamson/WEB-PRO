          <h3>Experience regarding Social life</h3>
       
            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>Life in high School was amazing as the school was full of fun due the coccuricular activies which was involved and<br> this is where I gained eperience on how to socialise with people despite of their different nature</p>
            <p>This was always through the music activities that involved singing and dancing to the extent where I had been named <strong><em>KING DANCER</em></strong></p>

       
            <h3>Life at university</h3>
            <p>The acceleration of freedom has increased and the expansion social life crossed boundaries where by there was new students<br> interaction of which most of them were international students coming from different countries neighboring Uganda.These countries included;
          <ul><li>Rwanda</li>
            <li>Sudan</li>
            <li>Somali</li>
            <li>Burundi</li>
            <li>Tanzania</li>
            <li>Among others</li>
          </ul></p>
            
       
            <h3>Life outside school</h3>
            <p>Here the story changes when I am in the gates and the only friends being my siblings and also diverting all my <strong><em> energy</em></strong> to music production.</p>
            <p>This took me about <em>5yrs</em> to gain experience in music production'</p>
          
        <h3>Life outside Home</h3>
        <p>When am to talk about life outside school this is when I was done with my A level school and I had to start up somethhing that could sustain me as a youth</p>
        <h3>Love life</h3>
